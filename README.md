1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address? - Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers, Artemis Financial wants to modernize its operations and wants to use the most current and effective software security for their software

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? - I was able to use hash algortithms and checksums to address security vunerabilities. It is important to code securely to prevent any attacks and data breaches especially on applications that hold sensitive data. The value that software security add to a company’s overall well-being is ensuring that the company keeps a good reputation with its customers and does not lose trust and potential customers.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? - It was a little challenging to pinpoint exactly which vunerabilities were false positives and needed to be supressed.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? - I increased layers of security by using the HTTPS protocol, self signed certificates, encryption algorithm ciphers, and checksum verification. To asses vunerabilities I would continue to use the Maven dependency check plug-in.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? - I made certain the code and software application was functional and secure by running the code and opening the application in a browser to verify it is functional. I checked to see if I introduced any new vulnerabilities by using the Maven dependency check plug-in to run a dependency check.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? - Some things that I used that would be helpful in the future are secure coding practices, dependency check plug ins, encryption algorithm ciphers, and certificates.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? - I would show my knowledge and experience using the HTTPS protocol, self signed certificates, encryption algorithm ciphers, checksum verification, as well as my ability to run dependency checks to find vulnerabilities.
